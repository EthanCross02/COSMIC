"""
This script will be used to collect the classes, therefore functions
of every motor control.

Please be sure to comment liberally for each motor control so that it is always clear
on what you are trying to accomplish. It might be worth looking into python commenting standards
to keep everything clean. Please reach out to Ethan if you need any assistance.

The plan should be to create a master class that is 'Motor' that will house the GPIO
input and output variables so that we do not have to continue to reinitialize the class.
All other motor classes can be created as a subclass of 'Motor'.
